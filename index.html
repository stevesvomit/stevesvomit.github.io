    So, I think it's worth a play, I just don't know if it's worth it's full price of admission, at least not for everyone. If you are any level of potterhead, then you should 100% play the game. The scale of the castle, navigating the grounds and Hogsmeade and the "you're a wizard, Harry" feel of it all is amazing. They succeeded in really making you feel like you are in the universe. The map is also huge. Some people were concerned before release, but that was quickly assuaged after getting into the 1st season (4 seasons of the game [grounds and castle change in each]).  It all sounds like a great sprawling open world game.  The combat can also be surprisingly fun if you take the time to learn to combo.  It can be a button masher, but it's not nearly as effective.  Where the game takes a downward turn is in its item, looting, and voice queue systems.  To talk about the last one first, they didn't record enough audio for the main character or ancillary character. If I have to hear the main character say the same exact phrase one more time from finding a thing in the world that there are 65 of, I'm gonna dive her off a cliff.  Every floo flame you run past says one of two phrases and you can imagine you run past a crap load of them just in the castle alone.  That's a bit annoying.  It's really the items and loot that failed on, and maybe a little bit of main quest versus side quest, too.  For the items, once you've played enough, you never need to find another scarf, another robe, another hat every again.  You can buy items of your level from one of the shop once it's unlocked and sadly there is no robust stat set for items, so they just matter very little.  Items just have a simple offense and defensive rating and while they give them rarity (basic, rare, extraordinary, legendary, stupendous - I made that last one up and maybe even the first two), the rarities also end up mattering so little. It affects only how many times you can upgrade the item, but since upgrading items only affects one of the two limited states items have (offense or defense), it impacts very little. Additionally, you are going to just find lower rarity items, with higher ratings than what you currently have and you are going to rinse and repeat that over and over and over again.  The items you 'find' always scale at your level or one above your level. There's no finding the kick-ass item that you can't use for 5 levels so you have to hold onto it.  They've sadly made it very pointless. You can add one modifier to each clothing item and they have 3 levels - 1,2, or 3.  The rarest legendary items can get level 3 modifiers, but all these do is enhance certain spells or attacks...let me tell you - you wont even notice the difference.  Additionally, you may call its rarity legendary, but you'll find those orange legendary items all the time...you'll always have an inventory full of them. When it comes down to it, they oversaturated the world with items which eliminated any need to hunt for certain items or save ones for later on.  It's the flaw of the system they chose versus a fixed system. It's random. Every time you open a chest it spits out a random item or random amount of gold. Literally, you can save before a chest, open it, and if you don't get a legendary item, just load your save file and open it again until you get one.  The enemies don't drop 'special' items at all, so your going to fight all different bad guys - dark wizards, goblins, spiders, trolls; whatever, and none of it matters from a loot perspective.  You'll have boss fights as you do the main quest, but it really just about moving the story along. It's not like you receive this super rare wand that is more powerful, because your wand doesn't even have power. It's static to your level. So,items and loot sort of go together, but loot takes on one more annoying shape in this game and that's in the caves they littered all overâ€¦every area has 5-10 of them. It would be really cool if these were dungeons, with enemies and puzzles and then there was a unique item at the end. Sadly, their failure is two-fold.  One, they aren't of any length. Many are just run down a ramp into a room and there's a chest. The more 'complex' ones are, run down a ramp to a room and solve this simple puzzle to now open a chest.  It becomes repetitive and eventually completely unnecessary later on because you don't need anything in those chests. You don't need more random item drops, because you can just buy items near your level. You don't need the gold because you've sold all the trash you have found since the game started. My guess is they wanted to have cool dungeons, but ran out of time in development and just came up with a half-assed experience of a solution for them.  The spots were all on the map, we'll just program in some simple find more loot spots.  The game would have been so much better if there were 1/3rd the number of these caves and they were 3-5 times longer and more involved.  Think of Breath of the Wild's shrines. They needed that type of experience and then for it to actually mean something when you got through it.  So, returning to the main quest versus side question part of the game; they are just so disparate. The main question is a rich story that you look forward to seeing evolve.  The side quests, very quickly become repetitive and seems very pointless. That doesn't even include the myriad of 'check the box' things to do out in the world. The sheer amount of 'kill this many of this type of enemy' and then do that at each tier we created, is astounding.  Some of these have impacts on the game. There's puzzles that increase your inventory size, but they again eventually become so repetitive that you only keep doing them after the second tier if you desperately want to 100% the game. So many of the 'check all the boxes' things just unlock cosmetics.  I know some players care about those things, but they are so much better when they contribute to something else you are invested in within the game. They did so much right from an environment standpoint, they just poorly filled said environment. Flying a broom around the castle, the surrounding areas, all the way to the sea, is just a great visual experience.  Moving around Hogwarts, finding the secret nooks and crannies and all the unique little easter eggs they put in there is sooooo good!  Having two sets of armor you just walked past start fighting each other and you wouldn't even know it but for the audio queues are such nice little touches.  The ghost, the ghost in the castle are so fun and pop up in places, not even to interact with, but make the castle alive.  That's the thing, the castle feels so alive.  There's so many npc's in it (many you can't interact with, which is fine) and they often have their own side conversations going and as you walk by they may be commenting on something related to school or something you were involved in.  I truly do think it's worth a play and if you stick to the main quest, you are in for a very fulfilling story, but I just wouldn't recommend someone buy it at full price if they haven't already. Soon it will be $40 and that is a better investment for the experience.
